## Testing the sdk

A simplified version of how to use the sdk can be found at

where the cookies are set in-place.

## About the endpoints for the different SDKs

Here are the public paths that provide access to the sdk javascript:

Android:
http://sdks.adnomus.com.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/latest/android/client_android.html (HTML file)
http://sdks.adnomus.com.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/latest/android/adnomus_android_sdk.opt.js (javascript)

iOS:
http://sdks.adnomus.com.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/latest/ios/client_ios.html (HTML file)
http://sdks.adnomus.com.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/latest/ios/adnomus_ios_sdk.opt.js (javascript)
The native sdks should load the html file BUT after the cookies have been set properly.

### More info

These are the optimized files. Meaning no whitespaces plus compiler optimizations. Lets talk about giving you access to the full code.

I have sent you an invite to join a collaboration tool. After you join you will have access to the sdk documentation for ios and android plus the updated design document.
